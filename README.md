# **WorldHolidayDates** #

[![build status](https://github.com/goodudetheboy/WorldHolidayDates/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/goodudetheboy/OpeningHoursEvaluator/actions)

This project provides the dates and times of holidays around the world, specifically 168 countries. The data is taken from the processed `holidays.json` from [date-holidays](https://github.com/commenthol/date-holidays). Any interests in contributing to the holiday database should be made there, since this project is just a Java implementation to get data from it.

This project is still under construction.

## Building ##

The project uses gradle for building. Standard gradle tasks for the java plugin can be found [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html). They can be invoked on the command line by running `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` with the name of the task, for example `gradlew jar` to create the jar archive.
